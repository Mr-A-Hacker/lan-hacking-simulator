# 🧠 LAN Hacking Simulator

**Author:** [Mr-A-Hacker](https://github.com/Mr-A-Hacker)  
**Project Type:** LAN-only forensic simulation  
**Tech Stack:** Flask + HTML + JS + SQLite (optional)  
**Status:** Active — educational use only

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This simulator is designed for ethical hacking education, forensic logging, and dramatic LAN-only demonstrations.  
It runs entirely offline and stores all data locally.  
No external calls. No real attacks. Just pure simulation.

---

## 🧩 Features

- ✅ IP logger (auto-triggered)
- ✅ Browser fingerprint module
- ✅ Battery status logger
- ✅ Location logger (with consent)
- ✅ Webcam consent logger (live video feed)
- ✅ Modular trigger routes (`/trigger/...`)
- ✅ Local log storage in `/logs/`
- ✅ Login → Consent → Dashboard flow
- ✅ Raspberry Pi compatible

## 🛠️ Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mr-A-Hacker/lan-hacking-simulator.git
cd lan-hacking-simulator
pip install flask
```

---

## 🚀 How to Start

```bash
# Run the Flask server on localhost
flask run --host=127.0.0.1 --port=5000
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

✅ All modules will run locally  
✅ Logs will be saved in the `/logs/` folder  
✅ No internet connection required

| Fingerprint| Manual           | `logs/fingerprint_log.txt`  | Browser + OS + screen info     |
| Battery    | Auto             | `logs/battery_log.txt`      | Requires secure origin         |
| Location   | Button click     | `logs/location_log.txt`     | Requires user consent          |
| Webcam     | Button click     | `logs/webcam_log.txt`       | Logs consent only              |

## 🔐 Ethics

This project is strictly for educational and forensic simulation.  
It does **not** perform real attacks, scans, or data exfiltration.  
All modules are opt-in, consent-based, and LAN-only.
